# Stock Daily Basic Full Update Example

This script demonstrates how to perform a full update for the `stock_daily_basic` task.
It fetches all historical daily basic data for stocks from the configured start date (e.g., 19910101) up to the current date.

## Usage

Run the script from the project root directory:

```bash
python examples/stock_daily_basic_full_update.py
```

This script does not take command-line arguments as it always performs a full update.
